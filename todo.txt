- Add support for declare -path -stdpath -lib -stdlib
    -path add to search path (relative to patch)
    -stdpath add to search path (relative to PD installation)
    -lib load library (relative to patch)
    -stdlib load library (relative to PD installation)

- Add support for import statement. To properly support this we need to extract
  the exported symbols by the external library. Python ctypes should help, but
  can't see a way of reading the exported symbols ala unix nm.

- Generate a tree of abstractions when parsing patch files
- Decend through the tree until are no more abstractions
- Print all of these in pdlist
- This gives the bulk of what is needed to generate stand-alone patches with
  all included dependencies.
