PyPD Version 0.1 Alpha

PyPD is a set of python classes and utilities for parsing and manipulating Pure
Data patch files (http://puredata.info/). Pure Data (aka Pd) is a real-time
graphical programming environment for audio, video, and graphical processing.

The original intent of this project is to fill the gap in managing dependencies
between Pd patch files. Pd patches may contain references to other patch files
("abstractions" in Pd terminology) and these in turn may references further
patch files. However, Pd lacks any way of viewing or managing these
dependencies.

The main goal is to make it easier to view and manage the dependencies between
a collection of Pd patch files.

Pd is supported in "vanilla" and "extended" forms. Without any tools it is
difficult to know if a patch is compatible with pd-vanilla or requires
pd-extended. It's also easy to inadvertently refer to a local patch file and
this cause the patch to fail in other installations.


Version 0.1 Alpha

- Parsing of Pd files is relatively complete. All element and object types
  are supported as of pd-vanilla-0.43 and pd 0.42.5-extended.
- Support needs to be added for declare, but there is a work around by
  simply adding the declared directory to the search path.

- The first utility pdlist.py now provides the ability to list all dependencies
  in a given patch file. This can be used when releasing a patch to the
  community as it can be difficult to know exactly what dependencies are needed
  to run the patch.
